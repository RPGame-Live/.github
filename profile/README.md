<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Roleplay Game Live</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Live Roleplay Game with many elements developed around live content or playing in the now.</h3>

RPGame Live consists of several different projects that pull together to make one big experience: 

- RPGame Live: Monogame, a JRPG Boss Fight Simulation designed around live streaming and having a streamer host the game while their viewers join the roster to battle alongside them against mighty foes.
  - A host will launch a game and select either playing in Discord or Twitch.
  - Viewers will then be able to participate in their game by joining the roster.
  - A story may be given that leads up to fights and the roster will be faced against bosses to battle.
  - Rewards will be given if the players win.
  - Eventually we want to add the functionality of a server based boss battle where multiple hosts can connect to a boss and battle with their viewers.
    - These server based battles will get a time frame to battle.
    - Damages will be calculated at the end of the fight timer and applied to the boss.
    - If the boss knocks out players, the boss may be given some of the health back.
    - Each time the boss is defeated, massive pools of treasure are given to the participants.
    - After a time, a new boss will be presented with multipliers to make the fights more difficult or last longer, requiring more effort to take the boss down.

- RPGame Live: Discord, and potentially Guilded, with text channel based games and interactions:
  - Text based simulated boss fights (Similar to the Monogame version except that you join the fight within a time limit and wait for the fight to finish).
    - These fights will likely start off as randomly spawned fights from interactions made within the RPGame Live Discord/Guilded server.
  - Time based roster quests where you queue into a roster to participate into quests for the day.
    - A baseline of rewards for queueing will be given plus bonuses based on further activity. (An idea similar to leveling up in chats but instead of just a 'level' players are given interactable rewards.)
  - Text Based Dungeon / Maze crawling.
  - Many more to come, some ideas plotted on an idea board and just not enough information to commit.

-  Lastly, a website to tie the data together and allow further visual representation to a player.
