<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Roleplay Game Live</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Live Roleplay Game with many elements developed around live content or playing in the now.</h3>

RPGame Live consists of several different projects that pull together to make one big experience: 
- RPGame Live - Monogame, a JRPG Boss Fight Simulation designed around live streaming and having a streamer host the game while their viewers join the roster to battle alongside them against mighty foes.
- Next we have various Discord, and potentially Guilded, text channel based games and interactions:
  - Text Based Dungeon / Maze crawling.
  - Text based simulated boss fights (Similar to the Monogame version except that you join the fight within a time limit and wait for the fight to finish).
    - These fights will likely start off as randomly spawned fights from interactions made within the RPGame Live Discord/Guilded server.
  - Time based roster quests where you queue into a roster to participate into quests for the day.
    - A baseline of rewards for queueing will be given plus bonuses based on further activity. (An idea similar to leveling up in chats but instead of just a 'level' players are given interactable rewards.)
  - Many more to come, some ideas plotted on an idea board and just not enough information to commit.
-  Lastly, a website to tie the data together and allow further visual representation to a player.
