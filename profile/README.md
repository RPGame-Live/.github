<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Roleplay Game Live</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Live Roleplay Game with many elements developed around live content or playing in the now.</h3>

<p>RPGame Live consists of several different projects that pull together to make one big experience. At the baseline, we have RPGame Live - Monogame, a JRPG Boss Fight Simulation where a host loads a game, joins their game to either the RPGame Live Discord or their live stream channel (currently only working on twitch the goal is to release for other platforms as well. The original goal of the live stream version game was to create an entertaining, somewhat idle based, roleplay battle game that helps streamers and viewers connect. </p>
